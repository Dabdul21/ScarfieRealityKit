 - Phase 1: Setup Basic Face and Head Detection -

     1. Integrate ARKit for Face Tracking:
 Ensure ARKit detects faces reliably using ARFaceTrackingConfiguration.
 Test face detection with the current implementation to confirm functionality.

    2. Capture Camera Frames for Analysis:
 Use ARSessionDelegate to retrieve frames (ARFrame.capturedImage) for further analysis.
 Convert frames to a format suitable for image analysis, such as CIImage.


   - Phase 2: Implement Scarf Detection -
 
    3. Choose a Machine Learning Approach:
 
    Option 1:
 Train a custom Core ML model to detect headscarves.
 Collect a dataset of images with and without headscarves.
 Train a model using tools like TensorFlow or Create ML, exporting it as .mlmodel.
 
    Option 2:
 Use a pre-trained object detection model like YOLO or MobileNet.
 Fine-tune it to recognize headscarves.
 

 
    4. Integrate Core ML for Scarf Detection:

 Add the trained .mlmodel to Xcode project.
 Use Vision to analyze camera frames and detect if a headscarf is present.
 Create a @Binding variable (isHeadscarfDetected) to update the UI dynamically.
 
 
 
    5. Test Scarf Detection:
 Test the app with different lighting, angles, and scarf types to ensure reliable detection


    -Phase 3: Overlay Virtual Scarves
 
    6. Add Virtual Scarves to the Scene:
        Create 3D scarf models in .usdz or .reality format.
        Add these models to your Xcode project.

    7. Position the Virtual Scarf:

    Use the ARFaceAnchor's transform matrix to align the virtual scarf with the user's head.
    Ensure the virtual scarf overlays correctly on top of the detected headscarf.
    
    8. Allow Virtual Scarf Switching:

    Add buttons in the UI to switch between different scarf designs.
    Update the material or replace the 3D model dynamically based on user selection.
